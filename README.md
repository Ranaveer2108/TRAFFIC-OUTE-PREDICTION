# TRAFFIC-OUTE-PREDICTION
In this project based on traffic congestion we are predicting alternate route for the passengers, to predict route we are training various machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest and each algorithm performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, FSCORE and confusion matrix graph.
